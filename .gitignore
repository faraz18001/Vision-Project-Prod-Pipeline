#   For a library or binary, you wish to ignore these files, but for an app,

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail to install them.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipenv, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
